# Fallout Hacking Assistant

## Greeting and Welcome to the Fallout Hacking Assistant
This program is designed to recieve a list of possible words and help you guess the right possible answers based on mathematics and stuff!  

Simply enter your list, one by one, into my memory banks and from there you have a variety of options!  
Upon completing your list, I can provide you with 5 suitable first guesses based on a score that tracks the similarity of each word to the rest!  
If you've gone and jumped the gun and already made a guess, then add the similarity score it spat out at you to the same word within my memory, so that I can make another educated guess for you!  
Through this process we should be able to get you the right answer no matter the challenge!  

Happy Hacking Vault Hunters!
